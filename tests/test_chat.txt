The video description is: If you’ve ever gardened, you know weeds grow super-fast. They can take over a garden overnight! But what does “grow like a weed” mean in other situations?   

A: Hey, Dan. Do you want to see pictures from my trip home?   
D: Oh, geez, I would love to, uh, but… 
A: Great! This is me with my little cousin, Arlo!   
D: Little? He’s taller than you.  
A: I know! He is growing like a weed! He’s only 10.   
D: Does he have a beard?   

To “grow like a weed” just means to grow very quickly! We mostly use this expression when talking about how fast children grow.   

And that’s English in a Minute!
